The Ruler of 2RERO believes that every citizen of the country should have access to a library. Unfortunately, 2RERO was hit by a tornado that
destroyed all of its libraries and obstructed its roads! As you are the greatest programmer of 2RERO, the ruler wants your help to repair the roads
and build some new libraries efficiently.
2RERO has n cities numbered from 1 to n. The cities are connected by m bidirectional roads. A citizen has access to a library if:
 Their city contains a library.
 They can travel by road from their city to a city containing a library.
Example
The following figure is a sample map of 2RERO where the dotted lines denote obstructed roads:

The cost of repairing any road is dollars, and the cost to build a library in any city is dollars. We can build 5 roads at a cost
of 5x2=10 and 2 libraries for a cost of 6. We do not need to rebuild one of the roads in the cycle to have these cities
connected.
You are given q queries, where each query consists of a map of 2RERO and value of and . For each query, find the minimum cost of
making libraries accessible to all the citizens.
Function Description
Complete the function roadsAndLibraries.
roadsAndLibraries has the following parameters:
 int n: integer, the number of cities
 int c_lib: integer, the cost to build a library
 int c_road: integer, the cost to repair a road
 int cities[m][2]: 2D array of integers where each contains two integers that represent cities connected by an obstructed road.
Returns: int: The minimal cost of providing libraries to all.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer q, that denotes the number of queries.

The subsequent lines describe each query in the following format:
- The first line contains four space-separated integers that describe the respective values of n,m, Clib and Croad, the number of cities, number of
roads, cost of a library and cost of a road.
- Each of the next m lines contains two space-separated integers, u[i] and v[i], that describe a bidirectional road that connects cities u[i] and v[i]
.

Exlanation
Perform the following q=2 queries:
1. 2RERO contains n=3 cities connected by m=3 bidirectional roads. The price of building a library is and the price for
repairing a road is .



The cheapest way to make libraries accessible to all is to:

Build a library in city 1 at a cost of  x = 2.
Build the road between cities 1 and 2 at a cost of y = 1.
Build the road between cities 2 and 3 at a cost of y = 1.
This gives a total cost of 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 . Note that the road between cities  and  does not need to be built because each is connected to city .

In this scenario it is optimal to build a library in each city because the cost to build a library is less than the cost to build a road.

There are  cities, so the total cost is 6 x 2 = 12
